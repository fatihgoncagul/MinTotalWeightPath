# MinTotalWeightPath
This was an assignment I had at Algorithms class.It's about greedy, recursive and dynamic programming algoritmhs.Here it goes:

We are given a COMPLETE BÄ°NARY TREE where nodes and edges have positive weights. Node  weights are stored in a 1-dimensional array WN. Edge weights are stored in a 2-dimensional array  WE where 0 denotes no edge.

Starting at the root of the tree and moving to either one of the children from the current node, the goal is to find the minimum total weight (i.e. sum of node and edge weights) path from the root to  any one of the leaves.


1. Implement the algortihm that generates complete binary tree with given size as input:
-Generate the node and edge weights random between 1 and 20 inclusive.

2. Implement the greedy algorithm (i.e., write a function) of choosing the child with smallest 
sum of edge and node weights each time.

3. Implement a recursive algorithm (i.e., write a function) to find the minimum total weight. 
You must determine the input parameters. Also, give the time complexity of a recursive 
algorithm that implements this formulation? Show your work.

4. Implement a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem. You must determine the 
input parameters. Also, give the time complexity of your dynamic programming solution? 
Show your work.

5. In your main function:
a. Show that the greedy algorithm does not solve this problem optimally.

b. Run each of the recursive and dynamic functions with three different input sizes and 
compute the actual running times (in milliseconds or seconds) of these three 
algorithms. You will need to calculate the time passed before and after making a call 
to each function. Provide a 2x3 table involving the actual running times
